	                <p class="article-text">
                    Over the past 25 years, I’ve witnessed firsthand how web design has evolved, and it’s been quite the ride. From static HTML websites to fully dynamic, immersive experiences, the web has come a long way. As a designer with a career influenced by Apple’s focus on simplicity and clarity, I’ve always been passionate about user experience. What I’ve learned from working with clients across the U.S. is that while design trends come and go, the principles of great design—clean layouts, ease of use, and performance—remain timeless.

	                <p class="article-text">
	                    When HTML5 became the standard, it revolutionized how we design websites. Gone were the days of relying on heavy plugins like Flash. HTML5 brought with it support for video, audio, and scalable vector graphics (SVG), all built directly into the browser.

	                <p class="article-text">
	                    HTML5 didn’t just give us better media support—it also paved the way for responsive design, which has now become an industry standard. Responsive design ensures that a website looks great on any device, whether it's a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop. Today, mobile-first design is more important than ever, with over 50% of web traffic coming from mobile devices.

	                <p class="article-text">
	                    My time at Apple taught me the importance of clarity and simplicity in design. Apple has always focused on minimalism, removing clutter while still providing powerful functionality. I’ve brought these principles into my own designs—stripping away the unnecessary and focusing on what matters: content, ease of navigation, and intuitive user experiences.
	                </p>

	                <p class="article-text">
	                    In fact, Apple's philosophy aligns closely with the growing trend of minimalism in web design. It’s not just about looking sleek and modern—it’s about ensuring users can find what they’re looking for without getting lost in a maze of menus, pop-ups, and advertisements.

	                <h2 class="article-subtitle">Microinteractions and Animations</h2>
	                <p class="article-text">
	                    Modern web design isn’t just about static content anymore. Subtle animations and microinteractions have become essential to providing feedback to users. From hover effects that highlight interactive elements to loading animations that keep users engaged, these small details can make a big difference.

                </div>
                <div class="clearfix">
					<p class="article-text">
	                    Today, with tools like CSS3 animations and JavaScript libraries such as GSAP, creating smooth, responsive animations is more accessible than ever. I often integrate these elements into projects to add that "wow" factor—without compromising the website’s speed or performance.

	                <h2 class="article-subtitle">Responsive Design: Perfect on Any Device</h2>
	                <p class="article-text">
	                    The term "responsive design" is thrown around a lot in web design circles, but its importance can't be overstated. With the increase in mobile traffic, every website needs to adapt to different screen sizes seamlessly. Using frameworks like Bootstrap and CSS Grid allows me to build fluid layouts that adjust based on the user's device, ensuring a consistent experience across the board.

	                <h2 class="article-subtitle">Speed and Performance Optimization</h2>
	                <p class="article-text">
	                    <img src="img/loading.png" alt="Responsive Design Across Devices" class="article-img article-image-right">Another critical area in web design today is performance. Users expect websites to load in under three seconds, and search engines like Google are now factoring speed into their ranking algorithms. Optimizing for speed means compressing images, using lazy loading techniques, and employing Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to reduce server response times.
	                </p>

	                <p class="article-text">
	                    I take performance optimization seriously with every project, as even the most beautiful site is useless if it takes too long to load. It’s all about balancing aesthetics with functionality, ensuring your site looks great and performs even better.
	                </p>
	
	                <h2 class="article-subtitle">The Minimalist Approach</h2>
	                <p class="article-text">
	                    The minimalist trend isn’t going anywhere. Minimalist web design removes unnecessary elements and focuses on what truly matters—clear navigation, strong typography, and plenty of white space. I’ve found that clients often come to me wanting bold, flashy designs, but once I show them the power of minimalism, they’re converted.
	                </p>

	                <p class="article-text">
	                    There’s a fine line between minimalism and emptiness. The key is to maintain balance—making sure your website has just enough to keep users engaged while avoiding clutter.
	                </p>
	
	                <h2 class="article-subtitle">Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Web Design?</h2>
	                <p class="article-text">
	                    As I continue to travel the country, working with clients in different industries, I’m always thinking about the future of web design. Technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) and WebAssembly are opening new doors for interactive experiences. In the next decade, I expect to see more immersive, 3D web experiences that go beyond what we’re seeing today.

	                <p class="article-text">
	                    But no matter where web design goes, one thing remains clear: User experience will always be at the forefront. The best websites aren’t just visually impressive—they provide users with an intuitive, seamless journey that keeps them coming back.
	                </p>
	
	                <h2 class="article-subtitle">Final Thoughts</h2>
	                <p class="article-text">
	                    Web design has come a long way since I started in the industry, and I’m excited to see where it’s heading. From HTML5 and responsive design to performance optimization and animations, today’s websites are more dynamic, faster, and user-friendly than ever before.
